description: "Hi there! Working from a Computational Social Science (CSS) perspective, I study how people perceive and react to visual and text climate change content on social media.My research focus on questions such as: How is climate change visually framed on social media? (specifically on X) and How do people react to climate change imagery? My research interest is situated at the intersection of social science and computer science. It combines computational text approaches (sentiment and content analysis, topic modelling) with automated image analysis."
