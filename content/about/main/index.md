  I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at the Technical University of Munich, involved in the Climate Vision Project, where we explore innovative approaches to understanding how people portray, understand, and react to climate change visuals on social media. This role allows me to contribute to research at the intersection of computational social science and environmental communication.

  Previously, I held dual roles as a Student Research Assistant at the same institution, working with the Emmy Noether Research Group and the Corona Research Project between 2021 and 2022. These positions focused respectively on analyzing media portrayals of majority and minority groups, and on researching public health responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  My current role continues my academic journey at TUM, where I completed an M.Sc. in Politics & Technology (2020–2022). My master’s thesis, titled “A Comparative Analysis of Mass Media Coverage of Minority Groups Affected by Climate Change,” examined how media influences public perception and policy on environmental issues, particularly regarding vulnerable populations.

  Prior to my studies in Germany, I earned a Master's in Government and Public Management (2013–2016), focusing on public policy, administrative processes, and their impact on social development. My academic path began with a B.Sc. in Government and Political Science from the University of Chile (2009–2014), which grounded me in political theory and provided a solid foundation in public administration and analytical thinking.

  Throughout this journey, I have expanded my scope—from regional educational support roles to international research on climate change. I previously served as a Professional at the Superintendencia de Educación, where I coordinated and monitored transparency in financial processes, and later as an advisor on economic strategies for Nueva Educación Pública. Each of these roles reinforced my commitment to evidence-based strategies and data-driven solutions to social challenges, particularly in the education sector.

  These experiences have not only shaped my professional development but also deepened my commitment to research at the intersection of data, society, and sustainability. My early exposure to complex systems now informs my current research, where I apply statistical computing—especially using programming languages such as R and Python to analyze and interpret large datasets. This skill has been central to both my academic work and the implementation of practical solutions at various scales.
