  I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at the Technical University of Munich, involved in the Climate Vision Project, where we explore innovative approaches to understanding how people react to climate change visual on social media. This role allows me to contribute significantly to research at the intersection of computational social science and environmental communication. Prior to this, I engaged in dual roles as a Student Research Assistant at the same institution, working with the Emmy Noether Research Group and the Corona Research Project between 2021 and 2022. These positions focused on analyzing media portrayals of majority and minority groups and researching public health responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. 
  
  My current role is a continuation of my academic journey at the same university, where I completed my M.Sc. in Politics & Technology between 2020 and 2022. My master's thesis, titled 'A Comparative Analysis of Mass Media Coverage of Minority Groups Affected by Climate Change,' explored the nuances of media influence on public perception and policy regarding environmental issues, particularly concerning vulnerable populations.
  
  Before my time in Germany, I earned my Master in Government and Public Management from 2013 to 2016, delving into the intricacies of public policy, administrative processes, and their impacts on societal development. My earlier academic endeavors also include a B.S. in Government and Political Science, obtained from the University of Chile between 2009 and 2014. These formative years not only grounded me in political theory but also equipped me with the analytical tools necessary to critically assess and engage with the public administration landscape.
  
  During this journey I have continuously expanded my role from regional educational support to international climate research. My positions ranged from being a Professional at the Superintendencia de Educación, where I coordinated and monitored transparency in financial processes, to advising on economic strategies at Nueva Educación Pública. Each role reinforced my commitment to harnessing data and evidence-based strategies to foster educational solutions to social problems.
  
  These experiences have not only shaped my professional journey but also deepened my commitment to research and development in fields that stand at the crux of societal advancement. My early career laid a solid foundation in understanding complex systems, which I now apply to my current research endeavors. Particularly, my engagement with data analysis and computational tools during my roles has fueled my interest in using statistical computing to solve real-world problems. The use of R has become central to my work, allowing me to integrate and manipulate large data sets to derive meaningful insights, which informed both my research and practical implementations at various scales.
